# Coding Interview (Clojure)

## Getting Started

If you don't already have Clojure or `lein` installed you'll need to do that:

### Installing Clojure

Easiest way (macOS & Linux (with linuxbrew))
- `brew install clojure/tools/clojure`

Harder
- https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure#_linux_instructions


### Installing `lein`

`lein` is the sbt equivalent, it can download packages, create apps, build, etc.

Easiest
- `brew install leiningen`

Harder
- https://leiningen.org/#install

### Editor/IDE

You will also need an editor, hopefully one that is capable of giving you structural editing capacity and creating a repl.

Easiest
- https://calva.io/getting-started (VS Code Extension) *I use this one*
- https://cursive-ide.com (Intellij Plugin) *well supported, but you need a license*

Harder
- https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider (Emacs Extension) *some feel this is the only correct IDE*
